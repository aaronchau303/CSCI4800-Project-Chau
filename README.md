## Build a RAG chain for Google Cloud documentation website

My goal is to build a RAG chain for Google Cloudâ€™s documentation website using dify. I plan to pull documentation from Google Cloud's resource center to assist users with cloud-related topics.

* User can ask questions about Google Cloud platform to the chatbot
* Chatbot uses the documentation that was fed into the model as a base knowledge
* Deeper understanding of the integration of RAG (Retriever and Generator)

### Building Process

* Dify: Open source platform for building AI platforms
* Open AI embedding model
* Knowledge Retrieval: using Google Cloud documentation website
* Question classification nodes
* LLMs with high level instructions for conversation after feeding knowledge base
